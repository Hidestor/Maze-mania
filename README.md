# Maze-mania

Maze solving, given in the form of black and white images using variety of algorithms such as:
                                        
    1) A star algorithm
    
    2) Dijkstra's algorithm
    
    3) Depth first search algorithm
    
    4) Breadth first search algorithm
        
* Used python module PIL(python imaging library) to extract the information from the B & W image pixelwise.

* Used fuction getdata() of PIL module to get the pixel information.

### Points about input image: 

- Each maze is black and white. White represents paths, black represents walls.
- All mazes are surrounded entirely by black walls.
- One white square exists on the top row of the image, and is the start of the maze.
- One white square exists on the bottom row of the image, and is the end of the maze.
